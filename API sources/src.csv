Perfect to play with when friends visit, at a children's party or when the family wants to do something creative together. When the dough runs out, the containers can be used to store beads, marbles, or other small things. Creating and being creative makes you calm and focused, and is extra nice after a day of school and activities. Working with their hands improves your child's ability to learn, and sharpens their fine motor skills. An ideal gift for children who love to do arts and crafts. Of course everything in the MÅLA series is non-toxic – we care just as much about the creative minds of the next generation as you do.

Not for children under 3 years of age. Recommended for children 3 years and older. Fun to play with, but not to eat. Pay extra attention if you create objects which are similar to food so that you do not confuse them with real food by mistake. If you store the dough in the containers with the lid on and avoid exposing them to direct sunlight, the dough will keep its flexibility and color longer. In an unopened container, the dough has a lifespan of about two years. If a piece of dough is left outside the tub and gets a bit dry, you can knead in a drop of water to make it softer. Do not place the dough in the oven, microwave or near other heat sources. The dough is not water-resistant, so avoid creating boats or anything else that can be exposed to or end up in water.
