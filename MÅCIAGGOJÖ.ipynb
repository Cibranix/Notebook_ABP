Pay extra attention if you create objects which are similar to food so that you do not confuse them with real food by mistake. If you store the dough in the containers with the lid on and avoid exposing them to direct sunlight, the dough will keep its flexibility and color longer. In an unopened container, the dough has a lifespan of about two years. If a piece of dough is left outside the tub and gets a bit dry, you can knead in a drop of water to make it softer. Do not place the dough in the oven, microwave or near other heat sources. The dough is not water-resistant, so avoid creating boats or anything else that can be exposed to or end up in water.
